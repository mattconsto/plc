	Problem 5: Fibonacci

	Take a sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ... and output the fibonacci sequence. Recall
	that the fibonacci sequence starts with two 1s and then sbsequent terms Arithmetic
	always the sum of the the previous two.

	In this iterative solution, we store a copy of the previous two, and have a
	variable to store the total and help us swap the values around.
